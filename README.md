# Bank-Profitability-and-Clustering-in-Vietnam

# Overview
Using machine learning to predict the profitability of commercial banks in Viet Nam. The use of machine learning models will help banks save time, cost and effort to monitor their operations in the best way. In addition, the author also clusters banks into groups with different levels of profitability to gain a deeper insight into the issue to provide some useful policy implications for bank managers to increase profitability.
# Data
The data is taken from the Vietnamese banking database provided by Thanh Ngo and Tu Le, extracted from annual reports and financial reports of individual banks. In this project, the author uses data from 27 commercial banks in Vietnam from 2010 to 2020 after removing banks that do not have complete data for the mentioned period. Based on a review of previous studies on the factors affecting the profitability of commercial banks, the author decided to choose ROA as the target variable and 10 features that are expected to affect the profitability of banks. ROA indicates the ability of the board of directors to convert the bankâ€™s assets into net income. This is a tool to measure the effectiveness of capital allocation and resource management of banks and evaluate the profitability of assets.
# Model
In this project, The models chosen for use include: linear regression, decision tree regression, random forest regression, SVM, KNeighborsRegressor and Kmeans.
